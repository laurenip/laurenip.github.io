              <p>In my first 4 months at <a href="https://www.publicissapient.com/services/customer-experience-design" target="_blank">Publicis Sapient</a>, I had the opportunity to participate in a company-wide global accessibility hackathon called enABLED Through Tech. enABLE aims to promote accessibility as a core principle of experience design, and encourages teams to instill this value in their day-to-day work for clients.</p>
              <p>My team chose to focus on helping those with visual impairments navigate through essential daily activities, like shopping for groceries, where it can be especially difficult to do safely during COVID-19 times. We were one of 6 teams invited to pitch and present our prototype demo during the week of <a href="https://idpwd.org/" target="_blank">International Day of Disabled Persons (IDPD).</a></p>

        <h5>THE PROBLEM</h5>
        <h3>In-store grocery shopping is difficult and time-consuming for those who have visual impairments.</h3>
        <p>Around the world, ​​43 million ​people are considered legally blind, and hundreds of millions more are living with vision loss. With the brutal spread of COVID-19, life for those <mark>living with visual impairments is more challenging than ever before.</mark></p>
        <p>Restrictions placed on physical interactions and touch disrupt vital means of orientation. <mark>Daily tasks such as grocery shopping are increasingly difficult,</mark> and according to the Royal National Institute of Blind People, ​​the proportion​ of visually impaired people relying on others to shop for them has ​more than doubled ​during the pandemic.</p>

        <h5>THE SOLUTION</h5>
        <h3>A virtual shopping assistant that helps users navigate through grocery stores.</h3>
        <p>GoodGuide is a <mark>mobile navigation app</mark> that pairs a voice user interface with indoor mapping technology to guide visually impaired users throughout their in-store grocery shopping journey. Using bluetooth beacons placed around stores, <mark>GoodGuide generates an optimal shopping route based on a user’s grocery list, then directs users to each item on their list by giving audio cues</mark>. GoodGuide also allows users to scan QR codes placed around the store to hear information about products located within a specific aisle.</p>

        <p>I played a key part in prototyping our design in Figma, from low- to high-fidelity, and led the creation of a demo video to showcase how our solution would be used. I also acted as the main liason between our team and key stakeholders, including an accessibility expert and representative user.</p>

        <h2>Meet Tyler</h2>
        <p>Tyler is a musician and photographer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He is actively involved in the local community and is well known as DJ and owner of a popular downtown social club. Tragically, <mark>Tyler lost his vision over the course of 9 months</mark> and had to quickly adapt, learning how to navigate the world through sound and touch.</p>
        <p><mark>With the onset of COVID-19, Tyler's challenges multiplied.</mark> Previously difficult tasks such as grocery shopping are now even more burdensome, due to restrictions on physical interactions and limitations of current technology.</p>

        <p>We designed GoodGuide​ with Tyler and people like him in mind, to make their trips to the grocery store a little less daunting. We met with Tyler to understand his pain points and experiences coping with 9 months of gradual vision loss, and how it has affected his ability to grocery shop independently.</p>

        <p>We had limited time to work on this hackathon (which we were juggling on top of our regular work commitments), so our design process was admittedly messy and rushed.

        <h3>1. Planning</h3>
        <p>Tyler would like​ to bake chocolate chip cookies this weekend, so he ​​adds chocolate chips​ to his shopping list through the voice assistant, and ​​GoodGuide automatically ​sorts his list by category.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“I’m planning on baking some cookies this weekend – I have to buy some chocolate chips and restock on butter. I’ll add that to my weekly shopping list and then I’ll be good to go.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>2. Arrival</h3>
        <p>Once Tyler ​arrives at the store, ​GoodGuide detects​ which shop he is at, and automatically optimizes his in-store shopping route based on this store’s layout to get all the items on his list.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“I hope the chocolate chips are where they usually are, sometimes they shift things around when there are promotions. It throws me off when items are out of their usual places.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>3. Navigation</h3>
        <p>Through in-app​ audio cues, ​​ GoodGuide offers Tyler​ step-by-step instructions and 360 degree audio pings to guide him towards his first item, chocolate chips, via bluetooth beacons placed throughout the store. ​Once Tyler reaches the aisle, he holds up his phone to scan a ​QR code​. Goodguide reads out the list of items in that aisle. Great, the chocolate chips will be to his right.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“Thankfully the chocolate chips are in their usual aisle. Last time I was looking for almond slivers, and instead of being in the baking aisle, they were moved to the snacks and nuts aisle!”</p></blockquote>

        <p>GoodGuide can help transform the way people living with visual impairment do their shopping. We had to ensure that it was easy for retailers to get on board:</p>

          <li><i class="fas fa-door-open font-purple"></i></i>&nbsp; <mark><strong>GoodGuide has a ​low barrier of entry​.</strong></mark> Retailers already track item locations on shelves - which Goodguide can leverage to create in-store navigation routes.

          <li><i class="fas fa-expand-arrows-alt font-purple"></i>&nbsp; <mark><strong>GoodGuide is ​scalable and flexible.</strong></mark> QR codes can easily encode data across various products and retailers.

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>I was so proud of our team for what we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time, not just in how we placed, but what we learned throughout the process. My main goal going into the hackathon was to <mark>simply learn more about designing for accessibility</mark>–and that I did! Here's what I learned:</p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li><mark><strong>Check your assumptions. Beware of unconscious biases.</strong></mark> During one feedback session, our accessibility mentor pointed out that we had a button labelled “View list”–and of course, a person who is non-sighted would not be “viewing” the list. I was so surprised that we didn’t catch this small detail...evidently, there are a lot of assumptions we make subconsciously when we design day-to-day, without realizing how it might impact those who are visually impaired (or have other disabilities). It’s hard, but being more aware of these unconscious biases is definitely something that should be practiced.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Think service-level, not product-level.</strong></mark> Accessibility considerations shouldn’t just live within the product you’re designing. It’s important to take a service-level view of the entire experience or journey–from how the person can access your product in the first place, to how they will use it in certain environments. For example–before deciding to design an app, we had to ask ourselves how accessible a mobile phone would be for the visually impaired. Was a smartphone even something they relied on regularly? Could we assume most people had them? Or for audio features–was this a feasible thing to rely on in noisier store environments?</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Designing for accessibility means a better experience for everyone.</strong></mark> There’s a misconception that designing for accessibility means improving the experience for only a small portion of the population (in this case, the visually impaired). But this is not the case! Everyone can benefit from accessible design. While designing GoodGuide, we realized that even sighted people have trouble navigating in stores sometimes–and that something like GoodGuide could really make grocery shopping more efficient for everyone.</li>

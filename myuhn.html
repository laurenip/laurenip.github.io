              <p>I had the great pleasure of working at <a href="https://humanfactors.ca/">Healthcare Human Factors (HHF)</a> as a Human Factors Intern,
                as part of a 12-month long co-op program. During my time at HHF I was able to work on projects ranging

        <h5>THE PROBLEM</h5>
        <h3>Medical laboratory test results lack clarity, continuity & accessibility.</h3>
        <p>A patient's journey through the public healthcare system in Ontario is not a simple nor very pleasant one.
          Plagued with delays, disorganization, and lack of communication from health care providers, <mark>the process for
          getting a simple lab test result back can be a major headache.</mark> For chronic patients especially, it is more
          than just an "inconvenience" and can hugely impact how they are able to navigate, understand, and manage their own health.</p>
        <p>While the current patient portal solved a small part of this problem for clinical visits done at UHN,
          many patients also got laboratory tests done outside of UHN, and were frustrated with having to keep track
          of results coming from many different places. Our challenge was to <mark>expand the patient portal to
          accommodate for this need.</mark></p>

      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h5>THE SOLUTION</h5>
        <h3>Empower patients with better access and better information.</h3>
        <p>The basic intent of the new design was to allow patients to access results from other private medical laboratories
          across the province, in addition to UHN. Patients would be able to see all their results in one place,
          without having to chase each one down individually. However, we realized that <mark>this wasn't only a matter of convenience
          and accessibility, but also one of empowerment.</mark> We saw this as an opportunity to use the newly integrated data
          as a starting point for self-management, to provide patients with the tools they needed in order to feel in charge
          of their own healthcare. So we created an experience that would feel <mark>informative, supportive, and as transparent as possible.</mark></p>

        <h3>My contribution</h3>
        <p>I worked with 2 designers to carry out user research activities during the discovery phase,
          including user interviews, workshop facilitation, and data synthesis. During the design phase I worked on several key pages
          of the patient portal, starting from the initial wireframes to higher-fidelity mockups and visual design.</p>

        <h2>I. Discovery Phase</h2>
        <h3>A "co-design" approach</h3>
        <p>Co-design—a creative process based on the collaboration between us and our stakeholders to generate ideas
          and design concepts—was at the core of this project. While design decisions were grounded in insights garnered from
          user interviews, surveys, literature reviews and secondary data analysis, I believe that <mark>getting end users to actively
          participate in our design sessions was key to understanding the true needs of the project.</mark></p>
        <img class="img-fluid img-in-body" src="img/portfolio/myuhn/workshop-approach.jpg" data-action="zoom" alt="workshop approach">
        <p>We held <mark>monthly interactive co-design workshops</mark> where we would review our designs with real patients, then make design changes
          based on the feedback received. Each workshop was an opportunity for us to test out new ideas and refine our design direction
          moving forward. We aimed to keep users engaged and involved in the design process as much as possible. This iterative,
          user-centered approach allowed us to develop the site from what would have been an informational ‘data dump’ to something
          much more valuable for patients.</p>

      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h3>Understanding the patient experience</h3>
        <p>We started off by doing some background research into current patient portals available in the market for
          patients to access their lab test reports and results, both private and public. We worked alongside the UHN Digital team
          to gather user requirements throughout the design process, and held a couple of <mark>one-on-one user interviews</mark> to get a basic
          understanding of what the common pain points were for patients at UHN. We asked questions like:</p>
          <br><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“What problems do you currently face when dealing with lab test results and reports?"</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"What does current myUHN Portal do well, and where does it fail?"</p></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“How would your ‘dream portal’ address some of your current challenges?"</p></blockquote><br>
        <p>Based on these interviews we drew up 2 personas—Robin and Alex—each with a compelling story that captured different aspects
          of the patient experience. Robin's journey represented <mark>patients who have had an acute illness or incident</mark>, and their experiences
          with point-of-care communication (i.e. interactions with clinicians) throughout. Alex's journey represented <mark>those with chronic
          conditions</mark>, who were more concerned with the self-management of lab test results.</p>

        <h3>Workshop #1 - Campfire Storytelling</h3>
        <p>We had <mark>6-8 users and 3-4 stakeholders</mark> attend our first workshop, which was focused on understanding the context surrounding
          patients’ pain points. We moved through a <mark>journey mapping activity</mark> with our users, in which we encouraged them to tell us their
          personal stories in a "campfire storytelling" format. We drew inspiration from the handy playbook <a href="https://gamestorming.com/">Gamestorming
            (by David Gray, Sunni Brown & James Macanufo)</a> and <a href="https://www.designkit.org/">IDEO's Design Kit</a> to carefully craft, prepare and
            facilitate the activities in our workshop.</p>

        <p>After the workshop we synthesized the research into key insights and recommendations, which outlined common concerns from
          our users and categorized them into several main aspects of the patient experience. This was shared with
          our stakeholders and used as <mark>our guiding "north star"</mark> as we moved into the first stages of design.</p>

        <p>In our second workshop, we thought we would try <mark>user sketching, a brainstorming activity where patients could sketch out their own ideas on paper</mark>. This way, we could see what users imagined their ideal patient portal to be in a "blue sky" scenario, and take note of elements that they thought were most important to include. We also prepared our own design to see if any of our ideas aligned with those of our users. We then did an <mark>interactive design review</mark> where we showed key aspects of our design to users and asked for feedback.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>operational needs,</li>
          <li>regulatory requirements,</li>

        <p>We linked each key element of the design back to the insights and recommendations we had gathered from both patients and clinicians. We wanted to show that <mark>our design decisions were based off real data</mark> collected from our users and stakeholders.</p>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>My team continued to iterate on the design after I left the project. While I was unable to see the final implementation through to its end, I felt proud of what our design was able to accomplish while I was still there:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cater to a wide range of users (from the layperson to the power-patient)</li>
            <li><mark>Activate & empower patients</mark> to be more engaged in their health</li>
            <li>Facilitate more <mark>meaningful & effective conversations</mark> with patients and their providers</li>
            <li><mark>Streamline & improve the patient experience</mark> of receiving/reviewing their lab results</li>
            <li>Eliminate redundant medical lab tests, and prevent the loss or chasing down of records</li>
            <li>Carefully <mark>diffuse the fear & anxiety</mark> of viewing health records by displaying information in greater context and providing guidance on how to interpret data</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Project challenges</h3>
          <p>One of the most challenging constraints was <mark>having to work within UHN’s legacy systems and their server's inability to handle large amounts of data.</mark> With over 50,000 users registered to the UHN patient portal, some features (largely related to processing queries and storing user input) were just not possible to scale—for example, allowing patients to view their entire history of results beyond the last 24 months, or allowing users to save their own report annotations.</p>
          <p>Because of these limitations, we were forced to think about the necessity of certain features and the impact it might have on overall patient experience. We had to <mark>explore alternative solutions</mark> to features that were deemed necessary, while keeping in mind the scalability and adaptability of our designs for future phases of the project.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
          <p>At the end of my internship, I left with some key takeaways and lessons learned from this project:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><mark><strong>Design is never done.</strong></mark> It is an iterative process that can always be improved upon with feedback, especially as objectives, needs, and constraints change over time.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Design is easily biased</strong></mark> from the way user research is conducted, so it is important to be aware of these biases. There is often more than one type of user, and design should always try to accommodate these different user groups.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Design is about compromise.</strong></mark> Finding a balance between satisfying stakeholder wants/needs and user wants/needs is key. Design must drive value not only to users as individuals, but also back to the organization as a system. Especially in an industry like healthcare, sometimes what users think is best for them may not actually be the case.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Design constraints are important to understand as early as possible.</strong></mark> However, while technical feasibility of the present should always be taken into consideration, designing for the future is how innovation can be realized.</li>
          </ol>

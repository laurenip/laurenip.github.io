              <p>My team was asked to surface UX issues, highlight high-impact areas for improvement and provide design recommendations to address painpoints throughout the end-to-end experience.</p>

        <h5>THE ASK</h5>
        <h3>GameStop is a brand that everyone used to know, love and trust as their local video game store down the road.</h3>
        <p>But as the world has gone more and more digital, accelerated by the pandemic, GameStop has struggled to keep up with its competitors in meeting the changing demands of a tech-savvy, digital-first consumer base.</p>
        <p>As part of GameStop’s digital transformation effort, my team was asked to help their Customer Engagement Team <mark>redesign their currently outdated website</mark>, <mark>conceptualize designs for new areas of business</mark>, and <mark>consult on ways to improve overall customer experience</mark>.</p>

        <h5>THE WORK</h5>
        <h3>My contribution</h3>
        <p>I collaborated with the Customer Engagement team on three main areas of work:
          <ol>
            <li><mark>Customer satisfaction survey</mark></li>
            <li><mark>Website redesign (customer service, loyalty & account pages)</mark></li>
            <li><mark>Concept designs for a new e-sports introduction and a mobile app redesign</mark></li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>I was the primary UX designer for the survey design, and most of the website redesign pages (customer service & account, with secondary contribution to the loyalty pages). I worked closely with a UX Lead and visual designer to put these page redesigns together, and communicated frequently with our PM’s and developers regarding requirements and feedback. I also contributed high-fidelity concept work for the e-sports and mobile app.</p>

    <div class="div-section bg-light">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h2>I. Understanding Our Customers</h2>
        <p>Throughout the project, we worked with our stakeholders and a research team to better understand GameStop’s consumer base. They presented us with findings from <mark>user interviews conducted online and in-store</mark>, through which we were able to understand overall customer sentiment towards certain website features and the GameStop brand as a whole.</p>
        <p>We also used quantitative data garnered from <mark>market research surveys</mark> to understand general market trends and consumer behaviour patterns.</p>

        <h2>II. Picking Low-hanging Fruit</h2>
        <p>With limited time and resources to spare, our stakeholders were initially focused on banging out features that were considered <mark>low-effort, but relatively high return</mark>.</p>
        <div id="survey" class="div-section" style="padding-top:25px">
          <h3>Customer satisfaction survey</h3>
          <p>One of the first designs I worked on was a <mark>customer satisfaction survey flow</mark>, an important part of the marketing communication journey that would allow Gamestop to receive valuable feedback from customers about their purchase and shopping experience.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-in-body" src="img/portfolio/gamestop/ratex.png" data-action="zoom" alt="rate your experience flow">
          <p><mark>Balancing ease of completion with generating enough quality information</mark> was an important consideration. I designed the initial email to be short and sweet, yet honest about why we were collecting feedback. I suggested we display the customer’s most recent purchase to help jog their memory but also also personalize the experience, making it easier and more meaningful for customers to give a rating.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="redesign-approach" class="div-section bg-light">
        <div class="container-narrow">
          <h3>Webpage redesign approach</h3>
          <p>We then gave GameStop’s account, loyalty, and customer service pages a <mark>UI refresh</mark> to make them feel <mark>lighter, cleaner, and more modern-looking</mark>. This included updating colours, font styles, buttons, form field interactions, error states and other components in correspondence with GameStop's constantly evolving design system.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-in-body" src="img/portfolio/gamestop/design-system.jpg" data-action="zoom" alt="design system guide">
          <p>With each page we pushed to make <mark>quick but powerful UX improvements</mark> where we could, making the website more usable, useful and desirable. We aimed to simplify the experience yet bring focus to the actions that we wanted users to take. And we wanted to make the experience more intelligent by using data in a meaningful way.</p>

          <h3>1. FAQ & Contact Us pages</h3>
          <p><mark>Improving online customer service resources</mark> was a priority for the GameStop team. One of our business goals was to improve the self-serve experience for customers while making it easy to reach a GameStop customer service rep when assistance was needed.</p>
          <br><div class="container-narrow"><hr></div><br><br>
          <p>The current <strong>FAQ page</strong> required a <mark>huge overhaul</mark> as it felt clunky and disorganized with an overwhelming amount of information. I drew up a couple of low-fidelity options and then worked with a visual designer to produce higher-fidelity screens. We decided to use <mark>an accordion format to display the most relevant Q&As</mark> for each topic, which would be curated by the content team based on FAQ data from current customers.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-pad-top" src="img/portfolio/gamestop/faq-lofi.jpg" data-action="zoom" alt="FAQ low fidelity wireframes">
          <img class="img-fluid img-in-body" src="img/portfolio/gamestop/faq.jpg" data-action="zoom" alt="FAQ high fidelity wireframes">
          <p>We called for emphasis on <mark>predictive search functionality</mark>, and showed how the results might be displayed. Finally, we added a bold section at the bottom to call attention to Customer Care in case customers needed further assistance.</p>
          <br><div class="container-narrow"><hr></div><br><br>
          <p>For <strong>Contact Us</strong>, we simplified the submission form and provided more context around response time and available methods of contact.</p>

        <div class="container-narrow">
          <h3>2. Account pages</h3>
          <p>We followed a similar design process as the FAQ and Contact Us screens. First, we worked with our product team to <mark>define business goals, user goals, and uncover any constraints</mark>. I’d conduct light competitive analysis where applicable, then dive into design exploration. After a few rounds of feedback I turned them into high-fidelity designs for developer handoff.</p>

            <li>Form will auto-detect the type of credit card, rather than have users manually choose between “Credit Card” and “PowerUp Rewards Credit Card”</li>
            <li>Added option for users to use an existing address from their Address Book, reducing workload</li>
            <li>Improved scannability by emphasizing card number rather than name, with an icon that shows type (Visa, Mastercard, PowerUp Rewards)</li>

        <p>Later we were also asked to help <mark>reimagine a new, sleek look and feel</mark> for their mobile app. We were given the freedom to revamp the entire app from the ground up, so we explored everything from new features, to navigational structure and microinteractions. We used mobile apps from Xbox, Best Buy, and Amazon as inspiration. When it came to the high-fidelity designs, my work focused primarily on the <mark>account/profile screens</mark> and <mark>interactions with a digital wallet</mark>.</p>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>Overall, the work we delivered for GameStop was quite impactful. <mark>My account page redesigns (totalling over 60 screens) were shipped</mark> and went live soon after handing them off to our developers. I was proud to see how quickly our team was able to put something out for consumers to see, despite the many back and forths we had with the product owners and engineering team.</p>
          <p>The audit we delivered helped kickstart a discussion amongst GameStop leadership to revamp their loyalty program and customer engagement strategy. It showed them how much work still needed to be done from more than just a visual UI standpoint. And while our concept designs for e-sports and mobile app were not yet realized by the time I left the project, <mark>we received a ton of positive feedback from our client</mark> about the work.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <h3>Picking low-hanging fruit vs. uprooting trees</h3>
          <p>Designing for GameStop was a very execution-focused process, with little time to think and much more pressure to produce. My design team worked hard to <mark>evangelize UX research</mark>, but it was often a struggle to truly incorporate it into our design process. Strategic decisions, like that of tackling quick fixes versus solving deeper problems, seemed to be made much higher up in the organization. Despite our low level of influence in the proverbial pecking order, <mark>I learned to really lean into my role as the field expert and consultant</mark> - handling client objections, vouching for the user, and advising on UX strategy as best we could, in the hopes that we could spark greater discussion about more transformative efforts in the future.</p>
          <br><h3>Change in leadership</h3>
          <p>Throughout the project, I was witness to a <mark>constant churn of people</mark> and change of executive leadership. And with this change in leadership often came a change of vision and direction, which of course impacted the day-to-day flow of our design work. It required us to stay on our toes, to be <mark>flexible and highly adaptable</mark> in such a dynamic environment. It also taught me not to get too attached to my designs!</p>
          <br><h3>An evolving design system</h3>
          <p>We collaborated with GameStop’s internal design team to ensure that the website redesigns matched the most recent version of their digital rebranding effort, which included updates to their design system. The challenge was that <mark>the design system was constantly evolving</mark>, with the rebranding work being done concurrently to our work. There was a lot of back and forth communication required in order to get everyone aligned on the same page. I learned how to work fast and efficiently in an agile process, but also how to communicate effectively and accurately with multiple players, including developers, product managers and other designers.</p>

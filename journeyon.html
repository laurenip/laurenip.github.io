        <h5>A TIDBIT OF KNOWLEDGE</h5>
        <h3>What is type 1 diabetes?</h3>
        <p><mark>Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the way your body regulates blood sugar, or glucose.</mark> While glucose is used to fuel your body’s cells, it requires the help of a key hormone called insulin—which people with type 1 diabetes (T1Ds) are unable to produce. Without insulin, blood sugar levels can spike up and down to extreme levels very quickly.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What about type 2 diabetes?</h3>
        <p>Most people are familiar with type 2 diabetes, as it is much more common than type 1. However, they are different diseases with unique causes and challenges. People with type 2 diabetes have insulin resistance, meaning the body can still produce insulin, but is unable to use it effectively. <mark>T1Ds are unable to produce insulin at all, which makes basic nutritional management much more complex.</mark> We decided to focus on type 1 because of the greater risks associated with travel.</p>

        <h5>THE PROBLEM</h5>
        <h3>Travelling with Type 1 Diabetes can be stressful, uncertain, and anxiety-inducing.</h3>
        <p>While a vacation trip to Mexico might mean relaxation and enjoyment for most people, it can mean stress and anxiety for T1Ds. There is <mark>a huge amount of planning and uncertainty</mark> associated with travelling with T1D that often detracts from an ideal experience—for example, keeping track of supplies/medications, constantly monitoring blood sugar levels, and preparing for life-or-death emergency situations. </p>
        <p>These travel-related factors can cause certain stressors and trigger emotional responses, often classified as <mark>diabetes distress.</mark> Our goal was to decrease this distress among T1Ds and instead increase their overall confidence in travelling.</p>

      </div>

    <div id="solution" class="div-section">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h5>THE SOLUTION</h5>
        <h3>A personalized tool to help T1Ds feel confident and prepared during travel.</h3>
        <p>Although there are existing resources that provide T1Ds with general tips and advice, many of them <mark>only address certain aspects of the travel journey,</mark> and are <mark>impersonal to their itinerary, treatment plan, and preferences.</mark> Users must actively seek out information that is relevant to their own situation, adding unnecessary burden to an already stressful process.</p>
        <p>So, we developed a digital travel companion called <mark><em>JourneyOn</em>, a mobile application that guides T1Ds through the entire traveling process,</mark> from planning and preparation to getting around their destinations. <em>JourneyOn</em> helps alleviate the burden of gathering and packing supplies, improves interactions with security authorities, and provides resources to navigate a variety of different travel situations, all in a smart and personalized way.</p>

        <h3>Initial research</h3>
        <p>My team reviewed a variety of literature and online publications in order to <mark>better understand the problem space</mark> and <mark>identify current gaps</mark> in technology. We scoured online communities, forums, and social media to collect some initial data (in the form of comments, discussions, etc.) from representative users.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Gaining deeper insights from T1Ds</h3>
        <p>In order to dig deeper into the underlying factors that influence their travel experiences, it was incredibly important for us to conduct <mark>1-on-1 interviews</mark> with T1Ds. We created a safe and open environment where T1Ds were comfortable sharing their lived experiences and were able to express how these challenges affected them on an emotional level. At the end, we left with five key takeaways:</p>

        <p>We realized that the emotional stress surrounding travel for T1Ds stemmed from a general <mark>lack of knowledge/experience.</mark> Those who had lived with T1D for much longer had already figured out their own methods and processes for travel, simply based on lived experience. Where there was a greater gap in knowledge was for <mark>those who were less experienced with T1D travel,</mark> such as youth/young adults with T1D, or someone who was recently diagnosed with T1D in a later stage in life.</p>
        <p>We decided to focus on the following 3 user types, all with limited experience travelling with T1D by themselves: <mark>1) Young & Inexperienced, 2) Recently Diagnosed, and 3) Parent & Child Duo.</mark></p>

        <p>A <mark>mobile application</mark> was selected as the primary solution due to its capacity to provide personalized information to the user, on top of the <mark>convenient, accessible, and portable nature</mark> of the digital platform itself. After narrowing down an MVP set of features based on importance and feasibility, we started to whiteboard a rough outline of what the mobile app would look like.</p>

        <h3>Quantitative results</h3>
        <p>We used the <mark>T-PAID scale,</mark> a travel-related version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale, to measure diabetes distress in users before and after using JourneyOn. The results showed a <mark>mean reduction of 23.5 points (SD = 14.9) in diabetes distress,</mark> which indicates a very effective intervention. A system usability score (SUS) questionnaire was also given to participants to assess the overall usability of the prototype, with a resulting <mark>mean SUS score of 88.0 (SD = 10.8)</mark> on a scale of 100.</p>

        <p>Participants thought the <mark>to-do list and supplies checklist</mark> were the most useful features.

        <br>
        <p>We also got feedback on features that were less useful, or required further consideration due to concerns over privacy or feasbility.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“Meal management doesn't feel like an appropriate area to receive advice here. It’s difficult to get accurate nutritional info such as carb counts, so I wouldn’t trust this anyway.”</p></blockquote>

        <h3>Principles of the “final” design</h3>
        <p>The goal of JourneyOn was to <mark>reduce overall TDD levels throughout one’s travel journey</mark>. Our hope was for the application to allow users to feel less burdened by the amount of information they would normally have to search for or remember themselves, and ultimately inspire greater confidence in travelling. The “final” design places emphasis on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler font-purple"></i>&nbsp; <mark><strong>Personalization and customization.</strong></mark> The most important aspect of the solution is being able to tailor each resource/feature to the user, based on their specific trip itinerary and personal information. This means making any tips, advice or suggestions directly relevant to the user—no more of that generic stuff!</li>
          <li><i class="fas fa-bolt font-purple"></i>&nbsp; <mark><strong>Ease of use and reduced workload.</strong></mark> User input methods are made as easy and convenient as possible to avoid putting additional burden on the user. Third party integrations also allow information to be imported from other applications, which help streamline and simplify the entire process.</li>
          <li><i class="fas fa-fist-raised font-purple"></i>&nbsp; <mark><strong>Empowerment over enforcement.</strong></mark> JourneyOn uses language that carefully frames things as suggestions rather than dictates what users can or cannot do. JourneyOn is not a medical device or expert authority; it is simply a helpful tool that guides and facilitates, giving users full control over how they use the information and resources provided.</li>

        <h3>Another round of testing...for another time</h3>
        <p>Initially we had planned to do one more round of testing, to see what users thought after we made improvements to our first design. <mark>However, due to COVID-19 circumstances,</mark> we were only able to show our high-fidelity prototype to 2 users. (Can’t really say much about the results of two participants, but both had an overall positive reaction to the design, if you were curious).</p>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>Through our work with Healthcare Human Factors on JourneyOn, <mark>we were able to help them further their research and thinking around designing for the diabetes community.</mark> We hoped that our research would not only empower the greater diabetes community, but also inspire others to address these kinds of unique needs and experiences using a user-centered design approach.</p>
          <p>As part of our efforts to disseminate this research to the broader public, <a href="https://laurenip.medium.com/empowering-people-who-live-with-type-1-diabetes-to-travel-with-confidence-d3cb79834dcf" target="_blank">we published a medium article</a> about our project and design process.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>Project challenges</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges in this process was <mark>finding representative users</mark> who were willing and able to participate in our studies. While we still gained valuable insights from the small group of T1Ds/caregivers who did participate, a larger variety of participants might have given a more in-depth representation of specific needs across the T1D/caregiver population.</p>
        <p>Another challenge was the <mark>huge learning curve.</mark> I went from having little to no understanding of type 1 diabetes, to learning all about how insulin pumps work; the difference between a Continuous Glucose Monitor and a Flash Glucose Monitor; what a basal/bolus ratio is; how important it is for insulin to be kept at cool temperatures...and the list goes on! But this all goes without saying that <mark>what made our app stand out to users was the attention we paid to those finer, nuanced details.</mark></p>

          <h3>Considerations for the future</h3>
          <p>Given more time and resources, there were several areas of consideration we would’ve liked to explore in the future:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><mark><strong>Account sharing & collaboration.</strong></mark> A recurring theme among participants, especially caregivers of PWDs, was concerning functionality that would support the dynamics of a caregiver-PWD relationship, especially in the case of a parent who might be using the application for their young/dependent child.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>Social connecting & community networks.</strong></mark> Our design incorporates aspects of social connection through a rudimentary “locate other users” feature, but this was intended more for peer-to-peer support in emergency situations. It would be interesting to explore the potential of building a more extensive JourneyOn community or support network to enhance the overall user experience.</li>
            <li><mark><strong>System robustness & information quality.</strong></mark> Making the application more robust in handling the storage of trip information should be kept in mind as it is used over time. Resources play a major part in the application, so making sure that the information JourneyOn provides is rich, comprehensive, and kept up to date should be a top priority.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
          <p>I found it to be such an eye-opening experience to be able to talk to real people living with Type 1 diabetes, and try to understand what they go through day-to-day. <mark>Learning about T1D through literature simply does not compare to learning from very human stories</mark>—something that should be considered in ALL design processes.</p>
